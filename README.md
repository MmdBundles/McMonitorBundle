# Minecraft Servers Monitor

Create your own service that makes regular requests to minecraft servers and sends the information to a webhook (your site).

This will prevent your site being blocked when making requests to servers.

## Install

* Install the bundle and its dependecies

    ```sh
    composer require \
        'mmd/mc-monitor:dev-master' \
        'sensio/buzz-bundle:dev-master' \
        'neitanod/forceutf8:dev-master' \
        'xpaw/php-minecraft-query:dev-master'
    ```

* Include bundle in `app/AppKernel.php`

    ```php
    $bundles = array(
        ...
        new Mmd\Bundle\McMonitorBundle\MmdMcMonitorBundle(),
    );
    ```

* Include routing in `app/config/routing.yml`

    ```yml
    mmd_mc_monitor:
        resource: "@MmdMcMonitorBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"
        prefix:   /mc-monitor
    ```

* Add parameters to `app/config/parameters.yml`

    ```yml
    # The secret used in API requests
    mmd.mc_monitor.secret: "my-secret"
    
    # The url to your site (with server list) where monitoring will send servers status updates
    mmd.mc_monitor.webhook: "https://my-site.com/monitoring-updates"
    ```

* Create database tables

    ```sh
    php app/console doctrine:schema:update --force
    ```

## Configure

* Set crontab to execute command that checks servers status and send information to the webhook

    ```sh
    cd /path/to/project/root/
    sudo -u www-data php app/console mmd:mc-monitor:check 3
    ```

You can specify how many servers to check at once.

The servers will be ordered ascending by last checked time.

Run command as apache user `www-data` to prevent `Unable to write in the cache directory` error.
In this case the cron must be set as root user for the `sudo` command to work in background.

## Usage

* Add server ip to monitoring

    ```text
    # Request
    GET /mc-monitor/api/v1/<secret>/add/<ip>
    ```
    
    ```text
    # Response
    {"status":true, "message": "Server added"}
    # or
    {"status":false, "message": "Invalid ip"}
    ```

* In your application, you must handle monitoring server updates requests to the url set in the `mmd.mc_monitor.webhook` parameter

The monitoring will do requests in the following format

```text
POST https://site.com/secret-url-for-mc-monitor/
{
    secret: "<secret-set-in-parameters>",
    servers: {
        "<server-ip>": {
            status: true, /* true=online, false=offline */
            data: {
                'hostname': '<span style="color:#00AAAA;">Awesome</span> <strong>minecraft</strong> server motd',
                'numplayers': 7,
                'maxplayers': 20,
                'version': '1.<span style="color:#AA00AA;">8</span>'
            }
        },
        "<server-ip>": {...},
        ...
    }
}
```

* Remove a server from monitoring

There is no way to remove a server from monitoring directly.
This is done for cases when someone knows your secret,
he will not be able to remove all servers from monitoring.

A server can be removed from monitoring by sending a json response to the API,
when it will make a request to specified webhook url, in the following format:

```json
{
    "remove": [
        "127.0.0.1:25565",
        "192.168.1.100",
        "<server-ip>"
    ]
}
```
